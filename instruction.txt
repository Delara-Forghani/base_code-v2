   while captain is sleeping here i have made some minor changes to the launch files for proper structure suggested by captian taher also i have added our own version of hushy created and edited by Mostafa
 i have also added the m-explore package which needs opencv3 and i have not worked with this packge yet
 the most important part ..... some minor changes have been made to ensure reliabale multi agent performence and interestingly on gazebo 5 you can have much higher realtime factor than on gazebo 2

  dude we had so many problem with gazebo 2 and its realtime factor 
 in fact when i spawned 2 robots with move base real time factor would be between 80 and 90 running with map merger would make it 60 to 75
 now with gazebo 5 we can run 2 models with move base and map merger with a real time factor of 95
   the main thing that was done in this commin was addition of map merger launch file and adding its functionality 


Mar 7th move-base launchs on little husky
